# CM3203-worktracker
This is the repository for my dissertation project as a part of my BSc Computer Science degree at Cardiff University.

The aim of the project is to create a simple, streamlined, multi-purpose work tracker that includes essential work tracking features in one consolidated place. The website features registration functionality, login/logout functionality, a to-do list that lets users organise and order tasks in terms of priority, a section for lectures (from Google Calendar, for example), and a section that pulls in assessments and gives users a suggested deadline to complete the assessment.
